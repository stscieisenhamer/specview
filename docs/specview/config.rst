Configuration Files
===================

To use STScI recommended settings, copy the ``*.cfg`` files from
``stginga/ginga/examples/configs`` to your ``$HOME/.ginga`` directory.
If you already have existing Ginga configuration files, it is recommended that
you **back up your existing Ginga configurations** before copying the files
over. You can further customize Ginga according to your own preferences
afterwards by modifying them manually.
