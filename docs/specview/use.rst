Using specview
==============

``specview`` interface layout is as follows:

.. image:: /_static/sview_layout_screenshot.png
  :width: 800px
  :alt: specview layout

There are three main areas:

* Plot window

  As the title says, this is where the spectral plots are shown and
  interactions with the plot occur
  
* Data

  Lists the data sets loaded into the viewer. The data is arranged
  heirachically into layers. Layers are simply subregions of the data
  set. Data sets are not all necessarily displayed. They have to be
  added to the plot using the ``+`` button.

* Model Editor

  Used to create models that are fit to a data set layer. The result
  is a new data set and layer which can subsequently be operated on.

In addition, you can bring up a measurement information panel.


Regions of Interest
===================

Regions of Interest, or ROI's, are the main method of defining where a
model fit occurs on a plot. New ROI's are created using the ``Add
region of interest`` button in the upper right of the interface
